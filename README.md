# Books Recommendations

There are many ways to gather information and learn, but books have always stood the test of time.
You would think that the Internet and Youtube videos would replace all these boring white pages but they actually complement each other. 

When you are reading books you naturally focus and even though it's possible that 99% of the content you end up forgetting, what remains is almost always something invaluable.

These are the most influencial books in my life in the areas I believe are key to become a better person and have a happy and fulfilling journey during our time on Earth.

If you can introduce some of the things these books try to teach you, science will be on your side. The rest is luck ðŸŽ²

## Health
No amount of money or success will make up for a deadly cancer, heart disease, alzheimer or overall poor shape.
And nothing impacts our health more than our diet, sleep patterns and stress levels.

**How Not to Die by Michael Greger**

![How Not to Die](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20741018/109691747-aab53f00-7b7f-11eb-9109-c94f652939c7.jpg)

This book is an exhustive review of what foods are scientifically proven to cause or help prevent the major causes of death in the Western World.
It divides each disease by chapter and after a few chapter you begin to find a obvious pattern ðŸŒ±

**Why We Sleep by Matt Walker**

![Why We Sleep](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20741018/109691944-dafcdd80-7b7f-11eb-82fe-0d56db0bceb1.png)

I believe this is the quintessential bible of the Science of Sleep. 
You will learn a ton of cool stuff, but more importantly you will understand that there is no such thing as a sleep debt and 'I'm fine with 6h of sleep'. 
You will regret it.

**Piece in Every Step of the Way by Thich Nhat Hanh**

![Peace in Every Step of the Way](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20741018/109689777-8e180780-7b7d-11eb-9eb8-469270fb2ed9.png)

This is something that is really hard to feel a palpable impact in your life (unlike the previous two), but for some reason I have been meditating daily for 20min since I started on this path and I just can't not do it.
No questions that major scientific studies found that meditating has a significant impact on your health and life quality, and many people swear by it, myself included.

## Money
Money is just a tool to achieve something. 
We should better understand how to use it and how much we really need.

**Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiwosaki**

![Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20741018/109692532-8dcd3b80-7b80-11eb-9d40-19fc55ffc526.jpg)

The classic. This book is really small and simple but it completely changed my way of thinking about money. 

**Unshakable by Tony Robbins**

![Unshakable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20741018/109694179-6d9e7c00-7b82-11eb-9fb4-2896513e213c.jpg)

Tony Robbins is probably the most well known 'Guru' there is. 
This book was a great introduction to the stock market and what are reasonable expectations when investing.
It also gave me a sense of how much money does one really need to achieve his goals.

**The 5 Mistakes Every Investor Makes by Peter Mallouk** 

![The 5 Mistakes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20741018/109694620-ed2c4b00-7b82-11eb-8aa9-6d59023b016e.png)
I just realized the author of this book was part of the previous recommendation. No wonder I liked it so much.
This book is just a down-to-earth, no snake oil, basic investor mentality and how to avoid the nonsense traps you get bombarded everyday as an investor.

---
## Motivation
You can be healthy and have money to spare, but you will get bored pretty soon if you don't find something to do with your life.

**Deep Work by Cal Newport**

![Deep Work](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20741018/109695299-a3903000-7b83-11eb-81c8-a92beade1843.jpeg)

This book was a life changer. 
When you turn down all the distractions and follow the deep work rules, your produtivity improves 300% (not an overstatement).

**The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg**

![The Power of Habit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20741018/109695863-55c7f780-7b84-11eb-8beb-d369e57ba0a9.jpg)

You need to understand how to introduce all this newfound knowledge in your life.
As Confucious said: "Knowledge without practice is useless. Practice without knowledge is dangerous."

This is a work in progress list of materials that really changed my life for the better.
Of course there are other great options, if not better, but the world is a big place and there's so much I can come across.
Nonetheless all these resources have well above average reviews on all the major problems so you should be good.
Now, get to work and have fun ðŸ˜‰
